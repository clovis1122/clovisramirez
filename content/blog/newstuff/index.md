title: Getting bored of your current tasks?

description: You might be in for a new challenge.

We've all experienced it before. Day after day, there's a point where your routine starts to get boring. You notice it
and try to do something different, but it becomes hard to find something new on a niche. Or rather, something _interesting_ and _challenging_.

There can be thousands of reasons to explain this feeling. Let's look at two types:

1. **The small things**. There're a lot of things that we just don't realize how boring and routinary they are. It might be your editor. It might be the way you type the commands on the terminal. That X tool might become undesirable. Ready to change your screen background?

2. **The big things**. Do you find your day-to-day tasks challenging? What about your current project? Or your current job? Perhaps it's time
to change careers? When was the last time you got a raise, along with new responsibilities? Perhaps something else along the way? Can we change our reality? (Alright, let's not go too deep).

When you look back at the small things, you realize they're fairly easy to change. A new background picture can be refreshing. Perhaps you finally got tired of typing the same bash script over and over and created an alias for it. This can be powerful, and is new, albeit rarely interesting.

The big things usually provide a refreshing experience, but these are hard to change. A genuine context change requires, if anything, courage. To go outside of the box we're so used to live in.

Your next task for tomorrow: is it _interesting_ and _challenging_?
